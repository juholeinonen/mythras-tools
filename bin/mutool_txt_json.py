Spiritshield
Concentration, Resist (Willpower), Touch
This spell creates a shield around the recipient which deters spirits 
from entering. Any spirit wishing to attack or possess the recipient 
must overcome the spell by winning an opposed test of their Will-
power against the casterâ€™s Folk Magic skill.
...
Witchsight
Ranged, Resist (Willpower)
Witchsight allows the caster to see active magic, enchanted items, 
and invisible entities (although such things are simply shadowy 
representations) that lie within range and line of sight. It can also 
penetrate illusions or discern the true guise of shapeshifted crea-
tures. Beings which wish to remain hidden or disguised must win an 
opposed test of their Willpower versus the casting roll.
